libgudev - GObject bindings for libudev

CHANGES WITH 219:

        * Initial release of libgudev as separate project.

        * Initial import of libgudev-218 from the systemd repository. No
          functional changes. It is binary compatible to the old package. Please
          note that you need to pass --disable-gudev to systemd. Otherwise, this
          package will conflict with libgudev provided by systemd.
