libgudev - GObject bindings for libudev

CHANGES WITH 233:
        * Require glib 2.38
        * Small documentation updates
        * Remove gnome-common build dependency

CHANGES WITH 232:
        * Fix crash on plenty of architectures in the test suite
        * Add g_autoptr automatic clean up for libgudev objects

CHANGES WITH 231:
        * Fix a bug in the enumerator to ensure that client subsystems
          are implicitly matched
        * Require a newer GLib to simplify some code

CHANGES WITH 230:

        * Bump version number so the package will supercede any gudev
          sub-packages provided via systemd. We intend to drop gudev from
          systemd-221, but lets be safe and just bump it to 230 now.

CHANGES WITH 219:

        * Initial release of libgudev as separate project.

        * Initial import of libgudev-218 from the systemd repository. No
          functional changes. It is binary compatible to the old package. Please
          note that you need to pass --disable-gudev to systemd. Otherwise, this
          package will conflict with libgudev provided by systemd.
